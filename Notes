This is for lab one. 
I decided to use the self check system for the mobility and AI driving components of the rover. 
This seemed to make the most sense for conservation of energy, and most effective use of the energy.

Additionally, through visual paradigm, I have made several connections, connecting the specifics of the components, as well as there general parts as well.

I can explain in further detail my through process behind the associations I made.
